    <!-- how to get the lat long for every project from an org: 
<!-- 1) get all projects from an organization
     2) when you use webservices, lat/long are included in the data
<!-- add the locations into all the projects that go with this org (this is kind of annoying but i don't think there's a way to download that info pre-compiled) -->


    <!-- write a script that: 
 1) obtains simple location (lat/long) for every project from a single organization
 2) makes a leaflet map element that displays a tear pin with each project's location 
 3) you can zoom, move around, and click popups to show projects name
if you click a link for more details, it takes you to that organizations page on the rcd project tracker  -->
